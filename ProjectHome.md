This app is the result of some research I spend on how to develop an somehow "leightweight" approach for integrating restful webservices in android applications. I tested XML to JSON conversion (thx to org.json ;)) and some other stuff. I liked the result so I spend a few more hours to build a "full" android app.

The app features:
- Voice Input
- Twitter "integration" (stay updated with the newest tweets)
- synonyms
- similar words

From a technical point of view you might be interested in:
- XML to JSON conversation
- JSON parsing
- asynchronous data downloading from the internet
- shape drawables

Because the source for the data is only available in german, the app is only available on the german android market.
